An animated structure for a Neural Network, which can help visualise how a neural network works and can be used to develop evolving networks using Genetic Algorithms -the network can, in fact, generate itself using specific instructions that can be encoded in a “genotype”.

NOTE: This is an OPENFRAMEWORKS project - you MUST have openframeworks (I made it in of_v0.9.4) and it must be placed 3 levels down from the main of_v0.9.4 folder.

As an example I downloaded openframeworks (version 0.9.4) here: http://openframeworks.cc/download/ and developed the project in of_v0.9.4_osx_release/apps/myApps/networkDiagram on my computer. If you download the project, please make sure you have a compatible version of openframeworks and that you respect this level hierarchy -> this source code cannot run outside of openframeworks
